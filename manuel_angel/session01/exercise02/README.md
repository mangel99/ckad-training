# Exercise II

## WP + MariaDB with replication

Create the K8s resources you need to deploy a WP site on your K8s cluster using
a MariaDB cluster as database with the characteristics below:

* All the resources should be created under the *exercise-02* namespace.
* The WP site should use a MariaDB database
* MariaDB should be configured with replication with a master-slave model. There
should be 1 master and 2 slaves
* Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to configure both MariaDB and WP
* Every pod should configure the CPU/RAM requested to the cluster, and the limits
for them.
* Every container should have the proper readiness and liveness probes
configured
* Wordpress should be publicly available while MariaDB should only be accessible
internally (you can consider your cluster supports LoadBalancer service type)

Once everything is setup:

* Ensure there won't be more than 40% or the replicas unavailable when running
rolling updates on slave deployment. You can document how to do it or include the
steps in the *commands.bash* file.
* Scale slaves to 5 replicas. You can document how to do it or include the steps
in the *commands.bash* file.
* Document the steps to follow to install HyperDB WP plugin and configure it to
balance SQL request between Master&Slaves services

## What to deliver

* *README.md* file with a description about the solution you developed and how to
use it. Please be as descriptive as possible and user "Markdown syntax"
* YAML/JSON files with the definitions of every requested K8s object. Templates
are provided.
* If you created your resources from the command line, attach a bash script with
the commands used to create them. Sth like:

```
#!/bin/bash

## Create ns
kubectl create ns ...

## Create secrets
kubectl create secret generic ...
```

Use the structure below on your PR To GitHub:

```
|
|-/session-01
|-/session-01/exercise-02/
|-/session-01/exercise-02/README.md
|-/session-01/exercise-02/commands.bash
|-/session-01/exercise-02/*.{json,yaml}
```

### Tips

* Use a linter to avoid syntax errors on your YAML/JSON files
* RollingUpdate Strategy: `kubectl explain deploy.spec.strategy`
